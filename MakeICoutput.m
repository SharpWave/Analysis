% Finally, it was processed by custom-made code written in ImageJ [dividing
% each image, pixel by pixel, by a low-passed (r = 20 pixels) filtered
% version], a ?F/F signal was calculated, and a spatial mean filter was
% applied to it in Inscopix Mosaic (disk radius = 3). 
%
% Two hundred cell locations were carefully selected from the resulting
% movie by principal component analysis–independent component analysis
% (PCA-ICA) [300 output principal components, 200 independent components
% (ICs), 0.1 weight of temporal information in spatiotemporal ICA, 750
% iterations maximum, 1E-5 fractional change to end iterations] in Inscopix
% Mosaic software, and the ICs were binarized with a threshold equal to
% one-half of the maximum intensity. Regions of interest (ROIs) were
% constructed very small to minimize overlap between ROIs, with width equal
% to one-half the width of the binarized ICs. ROIs that were too elongated
% (if its length exceeded its width by more than two times) were discarded.

%Correlation of Instantaneous Cell Calcium Event Rate vs. Animal Speed. The
%instantaneous rate of calcium event of each individual cell was determined
%from the number of calcium transients that occurred in the 1-s time window
%place symmetrically around that time bin (time bins sampled at 20 Hz, as
%stated before). Linear regression analysis was performed on the
%instantaneous calcium event rate vs. the animal running speed for each
%individual cell, to yield the distribution of regression slopes (Fig. 3C).
